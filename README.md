# Self-Service App Backend

This repository contains the backend of my **Self-Service App**, developed as part of my senior project. The Self-Service App is a cloud-based solution designed to streamline restaurant operations by allowing customers to place orders and make payments through QR codes, reducing human interaction and increasing efficiency.

## Project Overview

The Self-Service App was developed to solve the common problems faced by restaurant owners and customers, such as long waiting times and inefficient order management. The app allows:
- **Restaurant Owners** to create digital menus, accept payments, and track orders.
- **Customers** to view the menu via a QR code, place orders, and pay directly without waiting for staff.

### Motivation
The goal of this project was to:
- Leverage **modern cloud technologies** to build a scalable SaaS product.
- Minimize physical contact and waiting times in restaurants, a need that became particularly important during the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Key Features
- **Cloud-based Infrastructure:** The backend is hosted on AWS, ensuring scalability and reliability.
- **Digital QR Menus:** Restaurant owners can easily update menus and prices in real-time.
- **Order & Payment System:** Customers can place orders, pay, and receive updates on their order status.
- **Multi-platform Support:** The app supports both web and mobile users.

## Technologies Used
- **Go**: Used for building a robust and efficient backend API.
- **AWS**: S3 for file storage, Lambda for serverless functions, API Gateway for managing API calls.
- **React**: Frontend web interface for restaurant owners.
- **React Native**: Mobile app for customer interactions.

## Project Status
The Self-Service App is fully functional, and the backend code is available here for demonstration purposes. The frontend (React and React Native) code is hosted in separate repositories. This project showcases my ability to build complex, real-world applications from scratch.
